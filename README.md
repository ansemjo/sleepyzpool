# sleepyzpool ðŸ’¤

I have a ZFS pool with four HGST He12 harddisks.
One of those drives refused to spin down by itself, despite enabling APM.
So I wrote this script.

It watches the output of `zpool iostat` and records when there has been no activity on the pool for a given amount of time. Then it sends those drives into standby with a quick `hdparm -y`.

I got the idea from [ZFS disk spin down on fworkx.de](https://www.fworkx.de/2020/05/26/zfs-disk-spin-down/), although my script differs in a few aspects:

* monitor `zpool iostat` continuously instead of repeatedly for just one second
* don't be clever in detecting the harddisks of the pool
* no "inactive" timeframes within the script

The reason for not trying to be overly clever is that my own ZFS pool is constructed with four *LUKS encrypted* harddisks. It is possible to detect which drives are underlying a dm-crypt mapper ... but why? Just name those drives on the commandline explicitly.

### usage

There's two required arguments: `./sleepyzpool pool disks [disks ...]`

* `pool` is the name of your zpool, duh'
* `disks` is a list with all the disks you want to spin down

Additionally you can configure the timeout with two optional flags: `interval Ã— limit`

* `--interval` is the interval in seconds; `60` might make sense
* `--limit` is the number of intervals with no I/O before issuing the standby command

And optionally:

* `--quiet` will silence the `iostat` log output when all disks are spun down

### example

This is an example with a very short timeout (6 Ã— 10 seconds) on a zpool `tank` across four drives:

```
# ./sleepyzpool --interval 10 --limit 6 tank /dev/sd{a..d} | ts
